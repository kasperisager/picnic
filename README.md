# Picnic

> Picnic is a gorgeous documentation template for Jekyll

Picnic is a documentation template for Jekyll that came to life out of the need of having a simple and elegant way to write, view, and search documentation for projects of all sizes.

Picnic is heavily inspired by existing projects such as [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate), [Daux.io](https://github.com/justinwalsh/daux.io), and [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco). However, unlike these projects, Picnic is fully compatible with Jekyll-based GitHub Pages and can therefore be hosted without needing to be built beforehand.

Perhaps best of all, Picnic features full-text search using [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/). The search data is asynchronously streamed and indexed in chunks using [Oboe.js](http://oboejs.com/), so even if you have hundreds of pages it won't slow down your docs.
